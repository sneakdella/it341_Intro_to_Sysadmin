 | Jacob Yuhas | 09/21/17 | project_3 Admin Log | NIS |
---------------------------------------------------------------
+ Ran "sudo-apt-get update" -- Successful

+ Ran cmd "sudo apt-get install nis"

+ NIS installed successfully with the domain name set 
	to "it.cs.umb.edu" as the domain

+ Ran cmd "sudo apt-get install sysv-rc-conf" -- 
	sysv-rc-conf installed successfully

+ Checked /etc/default/nis to made sure it matched the lab document. 
	Nothing needed to be changed.

+ The subtle difference found in /etc/default/nis was on the "-no-dbus" arg. 
It is basically an argument that dissallows 'dbus'.
	+ D-bus is actually an acronym for "Desktop Bus"
	+ D-bus allows communication between mutliple computer programs on the same		 machine.
	+ Source of information: "Introduction to D-Bus" Freedesktop.org (2015)
	+ I could see this being significant when it comes to a database
	  requiring to communicate with a server program to retrieve information.
	  No communication between server and db no information given to the client!


+ Changed Permissions with sudo to temporarily edit /etc/nsswitch.conf 
	with the line "sudo chmod 777 /etc/nsswitch.conf"

+ added "nis" to the following lines
	+ passwd: compat nis 
	+ group: compat nis
	+ shadow: compat nis
	+ hosts: files nis dns

+ Ensured /etc/nsswitch.conf matched the lab example.
+ Changed permissions to 111 to /etc/nsswitch.conf
+ Realized mistake, Changed permissions to 744 to /etc/nsswitch.conf
+ Attempted to Back up /etc/nsswitch.conf via 'cp /etc/nsswitch.conf /etc/nsswitch.bak
+ Permission was denied
+ Attempted to back up /etc/nsswitch.conf with sudo. Successful!

+ Changed permissions to 777 on /etc/yp.conf temporarily for editing
+ Added line into /etc/yp.conf "ypserver 10.0.0.1"
+ Changed permissions to 744 on /etc/yp.conf
+ Ensured domain is "it.cs.umb.edu" via "cat /etc/defaultdomain"

+ Created home directory for my linux username: "jayuhas" located at /home/jayuhas"

+ Restarted NIS, command prompt provided no indication of success or failure.
+ Checked to see if NIS was running via "service --status-all"
+ I confirmed NIS restarted sucessfully via the command above output "[ + ] nis"

+ Following the steps above, I was given access to it20 by Professor Kelly
and was able to run "sudo adduser --no-create-home jayuhas

+ Witnessed Professor Kelly run the following commands:
	+ sudo make
	+ sudo sysv-rc-conf ypbind on
+ "sysv-rc-conf" from the manual is "Run-level configration for SysV like init
script links"
	+ It is basically an interface that allows automation of symbolic links
	  in Ubuntu

+ Tested log in to itvm25-3b as 'jayuhas' and it failed to authenticate.
	+ Investigated and found that my /etc/network/interfaces file was 
	  incorrectly configured.
	+ Swapped my interfaces2.save file which had my correct itvm IP address
	  into the interfaces file using "sudo cp interfaces2.saved interfaces"
	+ Began project 4 by following the first step only.
		+ Ran sudo-aptget update
		+ Ran sudo apt-get install nfs-common
		+ sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server

+ Tested log in to itvm25-3b with 'jayuhas' again and it failed to authenticate.
	+ Restarted itvm25-3b

+ Tested log in to itvm25-3b with 'jayuhas' for a third time and it authenticated.
+ No /home/ directory found for "jayuhas"
	+ Logged in to sysadmin
	+ Changed the owner of "/home/jayuhas" to jayuhas using the following
	  command: 'sudo chown jayuhas /home/jayuhas'

+ Tested log in to itvm25-3b for a fourth time and it authenticated and loaded
a home directory for the user 'jayuhas'

+ I noticed I missed a step "chgrp", so I applied the following command to
itvm25-3b. "sudo chgrp jayuhas /home/jayuhas"
