---------------------------------------------------------------
+ Invoked Snapshot Backup of VM for itvm25-3b

+ Selected option 2 for project_8
	+ I will be backing up my VM with rsync to it20
	+ Opinion: DVDs and tapes are a thing of the past.
	+ It is much better to do 2 on-site backups and 1 cloud backup.
	  in an enterprise enviornment.

+ I have decided to write a bash script instead of typing out the command
	+ The bash script will:
	+ - invoke rsync as "sysadmin" on my VM with the following command.
		+ "sudo rsync -azvv -e ssh /etc jayuhas@it20.it.cs.umb.edu:
			/tmp/backup/itvm25-3b/$DATE"
	+ $DATE will be a variable that will pull the current date within
	  the script.

+ Created new file "dersnc.sh"

+ Appended dersnc.sh to set variable "DATE"
	+ 'DATE= date +%Y%m%d
	+ echo $DATE

+ Exited vim and executed the script
	+ Returned "20171117"
	+ DATE works!

+ Appended dersnc.sh to invoke rsync command
	+ Returned: <alot of files>
	+ Returned: "sent 824,22 bytes, received 17,191 bytes 129,448.15 bytes/sec"
	+ Returned: "total size is 2,079,351 speedup is 2.47"

+ I used a script, the account sysadmin on itvm25-3b to execute rsync
   and "jayuhas" with ssh to it20 to backup to it20.

+ The reason behind two accounts:
	+ sysadmin on our local VM machine is in the sudoers file and jayuhas is not.
	+ There is no reason to use sysadmin on it20 for a simple task.
		+ Don't need sysadmin to write to the /tmp/ directory
		  by default.
	+ Permissions! I attempted to change into the directory of
	  "/tmp/backups/itvm25-3b" as it341 ON IT20 and it did not allow me in.
	  so I logged in a jayuhas and it allowed me in.
	+ Bottom line, security. No one else can see it but me

+ The difference between "/etc" and "/etc/" in our case is when rsync begins
  copying the directories with "/etc" it will create a new directory "/etc" within
  the /tmp/backup directory on it20 like this: "/tmp/backup/itvm25-3b/20171117/etc"
  and then store the contents under "etc"
	+ If the script were to run with "/etc/" it would create the directory as
	  such: "/tmp/backup/itvm25-3b/20171117/" there would be no /etc/ directory
	  and all of the files of itvm25-3b's "/etc/" directory would be stored
	  under "..../20171117/" so just the contents would be copied over.
	+ That would suck to restore multiple directories if everything just gets
	  shoved under "20171117/" instead of each directory having it's own folder.
	+ The Data would be backed up but all the files would be in one place...
	  which isn't good.
	+ For instance: two directories have the same file under its parent...
	  I.E.... "/home/jayuhas" and "/home/sysadmin" both have the file
	  "backup.txt" if the extra slash is there for rsync and rsync backs up
	  to the same directory for all the home profiles, everyones files would
	  be cluttered together and possibly overwritten.
	+ That extra slash causes a headache.
