---------------------------------------------------------------

+ Response to first question:
	+ rdist would be used in a scenario where an SA would
	  want to distribute files out from a server to a network
	  of client machines in a Linux enviornment. This can be
	  anything such as documents and file configurations for
	  the /etc/ directory.

	+ rsync would be used more as a mirroring technique in order
	  to retain redundancy in case a server goes down. rsync
	  is very similar to Google Drive but can be used as a backup
	  and mirroring tool. You wouldn't want to use rsync for distrubuting
	  files.. lets say for example a template was sent out for a document
	  if that template was edited and saved on a client machine for 
	  use later, rsync would eventually overwrite that file on the next
	  pass of it's incremental syncing task.

+ Installing rdist
	+ Executed command: "sudo apt-get update"
	+ Executed command: "sudo apt-get install rdist"
	+ Both commands were completed successfully

+ Creating the rdist script "myrdist.sh" 
	+ Script creates stores two variables with
	  the path names for rdist and SSH.
	+ used "chmod +x myrdist.sh" to ensure it is executable

+ Defining the distfile
	+ Created new distfile in home directory
	+ named it "distfile"
	+ Ammended distfile to show the following code
		+ "homedr: /home/jayuhas -> ( itvm25-3b ) "
		+ "install /tmp/home; "
+ Executing script
	+ Ran myrdist.sh
	+ Script successfully started and I was required to login
	  I entered my credentials and it proceeded to do a copy
	  of my home directory "/home/jayuhas" to my tmp/ directory.
	+ Note: I can see how this can easily... EASILY screw up
	  a file system if one were to install /etc/hosts to another
	  machine. It would be nice to have verification for each
	  file instead of the general "overify" parameter.

+ Executed again with new rdist file copying /etc/hosts to /tmp/etc
	+ "updating host itvm25-3b"
	+ "/etc/hosts: installing"
	+ "updating of itvm25-3b finished"
	+ Returned to shell and I changed directory to temp
	+ the hosts file was present and I checked with "cat hosts"
	  to see if all the information was copied over.
	+ Both files contents were identical
