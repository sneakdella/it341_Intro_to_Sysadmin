-------------------------------------------------------
+ Attempted sudo apt-get install autofs and encountered an error
	+ "Temporary Failure resolving 'us.archive.ubuntu.com'"
	+ Multiple ubuntu.com addresses were unable to be reached
	+ Checked Ifconfig, settings are correct.
	+ Checked "/etc/network/interfaces"
	-- Reads as follows
	
	auto lo
	iface lo inet loopback
	
	auto ens33
	iface ens33 inet static

	network 10.0.0.0
	address 10.0.0.172
	broadcast 10.0.0.255
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	
	--- end "/etc/network/interfaces"
	
	+ Settings are correct.

+ Changed /etc/network/interfaces file to the following
	
	----
	auto lo
	iface lo inet loopback

	auto ens33
	iface ens33 inet dhcp
	----
+ Restarted network service via "sudo service networking restart"
+ "sudo apt-get update" now connecting to the ubuntu distribution servers.
+ "sudo apt-get install autofs" completed successfully
+ Copied static file interface back over. Restarted networking services 
and the interfaces file would not take over as the new interfaces 
configuration. So I instead initiated a "sudo reboot"

+ Beginning to set up the /home/ directories:
	+ Executed "sudo mv /home /home.itvm25-3b"
	+ Created a new "/home" directory in root "sudo mkdir /home"

+ Modified "/etc/passwd" in order to include the user "sysadmin" 
as a local user and not part of the NFS. To do this:
	+ sudo vim /etc/passwd/
	+ located "sysadmin"
	+ Changed the portion of "/home" to "/home.itvm25-3b" to ensure
	the sysadmin account is local.

+ To check to make sure the changes had taken place successfully, I 
logged out of sysadmin on itvm25-3b and re-logged in to itvm25-3b. Log in 
was successful and I ran "pwd" to ensure I had a home directory.
+ When running "pwd" the console returned "/home.itvm25-3b/sysadmin"

+ Begin modifying /etc/exports file
+ Added the line "/home.itvm25-3b 10.0.0.0/24(rw,sync,no_root_squash,
no_subtree_check)
	+ The exports file basically sets up a security for the NFS
	on what gets shared to the mounted file system and what
	does not get shared.

	+ The "rw" property allows for reading-writing
	+ "sync" Ensures requests are committed to storage before responding
	to a request
	+ "no_subtree_check" when exporting a subdirectory... but also used
	when "no_root_squash" is used.
	+ "no_root_squash" is used to allow file directories that
	are owned by root can be accessed.

--- Stopped at 10/10/2017 -- Need Professor Kelly to do Step 7 ----
---- Begin 10/12/2017 ----

+ Professor Kelly uncommented my name from the "/etc/auto.home" file.

+ When attempting "scp it341@it20.cs.umb.edu:/etc/auto.home /etc/auto.home" I get the following error:
	+  Could not chdir to home directory /home/it341: No such file or 
	   directory /etc/auto.home: Permission denied

	+ Ran same command as sudo and it was successful. "auto.home 100%"
	+ It341 does not have a home directory so the other error "No such file or directory" so it does not matter for the operation I am attempting.
+ Restarted autonfs service and was able to log into "jayuhas@itvm25-3b" with a home directory successfully.

---- Questions -----

1.) For some of the machines I was logging into, it would not mount my home directory from itvm25-3b.
I logged successfully into itvm22-3b with a home directory as "jayuhas" versus the other VMs (itvm23-25a).

2.) The Client-Server model works by clients requesting information from the server. The server
provides resources to the clients. In some cases the clients may provide information back
to the server but generally do not offer resources back and forth. Servers fulfill requests
and provide information such as HTTP for client users in a web setting as an example.
