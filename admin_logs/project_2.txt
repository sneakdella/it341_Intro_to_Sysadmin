Questions

1.) The gateway IP address is 172.16.142.1 on DHCP.... 10.0.0.1 on the Static File at the end of the PDF
2.) The IP address of my computer is 172.16.142.130 on DHCP ...... 10.0.0.172 on the Static file setup at the end of the PDF
3.) I found this information via the following command "cat /etc/network/interfaces"
4.) A NAT is a Network Address Translation. A basic inbound NAT process consists of the router or firewall recieving a packet from a public IP address, changing the contents of the IP packet and sending it to an internal private IP. Rather than port mapping (which is an alternative solution at times) , you are mapping an internal IP to external and vice versa.


----- Question 5 ------

a) sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces

Edit the following files (add your netmask and gateway)

~auth lo
~iface lo inet loopback

----- End to Question 5 -----

6.) Dynamic Host Control Protocol. This protocol (typically on a server or network switch) will automatically lease an IP address to a computer for a certain amount of time. This protocol allows for automation of handeling IP addresses without the help of a human operator. DHCP rarely needs to be tended to unless a specific server/host/client needs a static IP leased to it, which can be done easily in Ubuntu with a modification of the hosts file. In a Windows enviornment, you would pull up the DHCP services and assign it and then give it a host name in the DNS records.

7.) The Hosts file defines a FQDN name for a machine and associates an IP address to it. It's a DNS record keeping file.

8.) NAT is Network Address Translation. In VMware standard a NAT will seperate the network that has a NAT from the main private network it is working off of. Bridged mode allows for the VM to act as if it is a physical machine on the main private network. 


BEGIN ADMIN LOG

+ Ensuring /etc/hosts file on itvm25-3b is identical to project pdf.
+ Running vim on /etc/hosts on itvm25-3b
+ Gave warning on read only mode
+ Temporarily changing permissions on /etc/hosts file to 777.
+ Added "10.0.0.1 it20.it.cs.umb.edu it20" as gateway server
+ Added the rest of the itvms in the lab to the /etc/hosts file on itvm25-3b and confirmed their records in the host files matches that of it20's /etc/hosts file
+ Added the rest of the it lab client computers to host file
+ Cross checked information, and hosts file looks accurate.
+ Changed permissions back to read only for /etc/hosts to prevent deletion or overwriting
+ Shutdown itvm25-3b
+ Modified "Network Adapter" settings in VMWare on Virtual Machine itvm25-3b from "NAT" to "Bridged"
+ Applied settings to VM
+ Started Up itvm25-3b
+ Logged in as sysadmin
+ Ran "ping it20" and shell output replied with "64 Bytes from it20.it.cs.umb.edu (10.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.3ms" continously.
+ Ran "ping itvm25-3a", outcome was similar to above and successful
+ Ran "ping www.yahoo.com", outcome was similar to above and successful
+ Ran "ssh sysadmin@itvm25-3a" and logged in to itvm25-3a successfully as sysadmin
+ Took Snapshot of VM
+ Ran command "sudo cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces.saved
+ Checked /etc/hosts/ for itvm25-3b's static IP address
+ itvm25-3b's static IP is "10.0.0.172"
+ Temporarily changed permissions on /etc/network/interfaces to allow editing
+ BEGIN EDITING /etc/network/interfaces file
+ Changed "iface ens33 inet dhcp" to "iface ens33 inet static"
+ Added "network 10.0.0.0" to file
+ Added "address 10.0.0.172" to file
+ Added "gateway 10.0.0.1" to file
+ Added "broadcast 255.255.255.0" to file
+ DONE EDITING /etc/network/interfaces file
+ Changes were successfully written
+ Network services restarted "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart"
+ Network services restart successful
+ Changed permissions back to read only on /etc/network/interfaces
+ Ping to "www.yahoo.com" successful
+ Ping to itvm25-3a successful
+ Ping to itvm28-3a successful
+ "ssh sysadmin@itvm25-3a" successful
+ Copied interfaces.saved file back to /etc/network/interfaces
+ Restarted Networking Service Successfully
+ Took another snapshot of VM
+ Copied and zipped VM in another location on host computer
+ NOTE ...
+ To allow myself to SSH into itvm25-3b I reverted step 7 and restored the static settings I originally had.
+ Network Services restarted successfully.
