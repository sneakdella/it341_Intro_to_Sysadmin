-----------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Ensured ethernet cable is plugged into correct ethernet jack (IT20)

+ Logged onto itvm25-3b as sysadmin

+ Created new directory in root
	+ "sudo mkdir guests"

+ made "/guests" directory modifiable by anyone
	+ sudo chmod 777 guests

+ Changed directory to /usr/local/bin

+ Created new script
	+ sudo vim autobackup.sh

+ Within vim I added the following lines
	+ #! /bin/bash
	+ #
	+ # shell script to perform daily backups of /etc

	+ if [ $# -lt 2 ]
	+ then
	+ echo Usage: $(basename $0) BACKUP_HOST BACKUP_DIRECTORY
	+ exit 1
	+ fi

	+ backup_host=$1
	+ backup_dir=$2
	+ date=$(date +%F)
	+ rsync -azvv -e ssh /etc $backup_host.it.cs.umb.edu:/$backup_dir/$date

+ Exited vim with ":x" (save and quit)

+ Changed the permissions on autobackup.sh
	+ "sudo chmod 755 autobackup.sh"


+ Logged out of sysadmin

+ Logged into itvm22-3b
	+ created /guests directory in root
	+ changed permissions to 777 with chmod for /guests
	+ created /guests/itvm25-3b directory

+ Logged out of itvm22-3b

+ Logged back into itvm25-3b as sysadmin

+ Executed 'autobackup.sh itvm22-3a /guests/itvm25-3b' from /usr/local/bin

+ Script was successful however it could not open /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow...

+ Ran script again with sudo and it worked 100%

+ ssh sysadmin@itvm22-3a 'ls /guests/itvm25-3b' -- the file was present!
	+ The same ssh command above except changed 
	  'ls /guests/itvm25-3b/2017-11-17/etc' to see all the files

+ Removed the backup directory from the other machine with the following command:
	+ "ssh sysadmin@itvm22-3a 'rm -rf /guests/itvm25-3b/2017-11-17'

+ Checked to make sure files were deleted with
	+ "ssh sysadmin@itvm22-3a 'ls /guests/itvm25-3b/'"
	+ Shell returned nothing, which means nothing is there.

+ Attempted with CRON and nothing is showing in "/guests/itvm25-3b" on itvm22-3a
	+ Checked /var/log/syslog and CRON is executing the command however there is no MTA to report the output.
	+ MTA is basically a mail system.
	+ Redirected from MTA to a log file under /cron/log.txt
	
+ Following error was discovered:
	
	opening connection using: ssh itvm22-3a.it.cs.umb.edu rsync --server -vvlogDtprze.iLsfx . //guests/itvm25-3b/2017-11-17  (7 args)
	Permission denied, please try again.
	Permission denied, please try again.
	Permission denied (publickey,password).
	rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
	rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(226) [sender		=3.1.1]

+ Remade id_rsa key as a blank private key "ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048"

+ Received same error as above but instead of permission denied I got "Host 
	verification has failed."

+ Appended authorized_keys file with "cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys"
 
+ Made multiple tries of the following:
	+ Changing the id_rsa keys, (by making new ones)
	+ Changing the destination VM.

+ Still getting "Host key verification failed"

+ Commented out "source $HOME/.keychain/`/bin/hostname`-sh" 

+ Verified that I can log on without needing to type pass-phrase to other
	VMs on the account "jayuhas" -- found it does not work with
	itvm22-3a.... so I switched to itvm28-3b and it worked for pass
	phrase.

+ Remade the keys the blank keys AGAIN, added to keychain via the command 
	"keychain $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa"

+ Added "source $HOME/.keychain/`/bin/hostname`-sh" back into script file

+ Verified that I can log in as jayuhas via passphrase to itvm28-3b

+ Cron jobs ran again and "Host Authentication Failed"

+++++ continuation on November 18th, 2017

+ Discovered an error with the crontab -e file. The slash next to "guests"
  was producing a double slash. Changed the line to the following:
	+ “/usr/local/bin/autobackup.sh OTHER_VIRTUAL_MACHINE guests/VIRTUAL_MAC	   HINE_NAME”

+ Added "ServerAliveInterval 120" to /etc/ssh/ssh_config under "Host *"
	+ This changes how often the connection should be kept
	  "alive" when the secure shell is active

+ ssh-agent treats the same destination virtual machine as seperate known
  hosts if it has more than one FQDN. "itvm25-3b" and "itvm25-3b.it.cs.umb.edu"
  are the same machine but ssh-agent counts both DNS names as different
  known hosts, even though they both lead to the same machine

+ Recreated rsa keys with a blank paraphrase

+ Copied the "id_rsa.pub" and appended it into "authorzied_keys" once more

+ Executed the following command to add new RSA key to the keychain
	+ "keychain $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa"

+ On itvm25-3b I did a secure shell into itvm28-3b with the following:
	+ "ssh itvm28-3b.it.cs.umb.edu" instead of just "itvm28-3b"
	+ Logged out of itvm28-3b

+ cronjob ran successfully afterwords, minus "/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow"

+ Executed "ssh itvm28-3b 'ls /guests/itvm25-3b/20171811'"

+ Files were present
