YP.CONF is changing!! 
#
# yp.conf	Configuration file for the ypbind process. You can define
#		NIS servers manually here if they can't be found by
#		broadcasting on the local net (which is the default).
#
#		See the manual page of ypbind for the syntax of this file.
#
# IMPORTANT:	For the "ypserver", use IP addresses, or make sure that
#		the host is in /etc/hosts. This file is only interpreted
#		once, and if DNS isn't reachable yet the ypserver cannot
#		be resolved and ypbind won't ever bind to the server.

# ypserver ypserver.network.com
